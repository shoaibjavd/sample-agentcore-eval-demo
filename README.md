# AgentCore Evaluation Pipeline with MCP Role-Based Access Control

Reference implementation for running automated evaluations on an AgentCore-hosted agent that connects to an MCP server with role-based access control. The CI/CD pipeline deploys infrastructure, invokes the agent, runs evaluations, and gates the PR on quality thresholds.

## Architecture

## Auth Flows

**M2M (CI pipelines):** `client_credentials` grant → Cognito issues an access token carrying the scopes granted to the M2M client → MCP `AuthMiddleware` matches those scopes against each tool's declared scope requirement. A machine caller reaches only the tool domains whose scopes it was granted (`mcp/finance`, `mcp/hr`); there is no bypass.

**User-scoped (interactive):** `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` or `authorization_code` grant → Cognito issues access token with `custom:roles` claim (via pre-token-generation Lambda V2) → agent forwards token to MCP via `request_header_allowlist` → `AuthMiddleware` extracts roles → tool-level checks enforce access (e.g., only `FinanceUser` can call `get_stock_price`).

## MCP Auth Layers

1. **JWT validation (AgentCore):** Signature, issuer, expiry verified by the platform via `authorizer_configuration` before the request reaches your code.
2. **Header passthrough:** `request_header_allowlist=["Authorization"]` on both runtimes ensures the JWT reaches the agent and MCP containers.
3. **Tool-level authorization (`AuthMiddleware`):** Uses `fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_http_headers()` to read the JWT, verifies its signature against the pool's JWKS (issuer, expiry and `token_use` are checked; it fails closed), then authorizes each tool against the `meta` it declares. A gated tool requires a matching `custom:roles` entry **or** a matching scope — user tokens satisfy the role requirement, machine tokens the scope requirement. A newly added gated tool is denied until its scope is explicitly granted.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with Bedrock AgentCore access
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+ and the AWS CDK CLI (`npm install -g aws-cdk`) — the CLI is a Node package and is
  *not* installed by `pip install .`, which only provides the Python `aws-cdk-lib` used by `app.py`
- CDK bootstrapped in `ap-southeast-2` (`cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/ap-southeast-2`) — the
  region is pinned in `app.py`, so bootstrapping only your default region is not enough
- Docker installed and running. Both images build for `linux/arm64`: this is native on Apple
  Silicon, but on x86 hosts you need emulation (`docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64`),
  which is what the CI workflow's QEMU step provides

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is via the notebooks:

1. Open `notebooks/01_deploy_and_test_rbac.ipynb` — deploys the stack, sets user passwords, and runs role-based access tests.
2. Open `notebooks/02_evaluation_pipeline.ipynb` — runs the evaluation pipeline with M2M token and quality gates.

Both notebooks deploy via `npx --yes cdk`, so they do not need a globally installed CDK CLI — but
they do still need the `.venv` created below (they run CDK with `.venv/bin` on `PATH`), plus Node.js
and a running Docker daemon. Each notebook deploys the stack in its first cells and **runs
`cdk destroy --force` in its final cell**, so run them one at a time and skip the last cell if you
want the stack to stay up.

## Deployment

```bash
# Install the Python CDK libraries that app.py imports (aws-cdk-lib, constructs)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .

# Deploy the stack (requires the CDK CLI — see Prerequisites)
cdk deploy --outputs-file outputs.json

# No global CDK CLI? Run it via npx instead:
# npx aws-cdk@2 deploy --outputs-file outputs.json
```

The stack deploys into `ap-southeast-2` (pinned in `app.py`) using the account resolved from your
current credentials. Deployment builds and pushes both container images to ECR before creating the
AgentCore runtimes, so allow around 10-15 minutes on a first run.

Both runtimes stay in `CREATING` for a few minutes after `cdk deploy` returns, and invoking one
before it reaches `READY` fails with `424 Failed Dependency`. `scripts/agentcore_eval.py` polls for
`READY` before invoking; the notebooks instead pause for a fixed 30s, which is usually but not
always enough — if a notebook invocation returns 424, re-run that cell.

CDK outputs include: `SharedUserPoolId`, `M2MClientId`, `UserClientId`, `TokenEndpoint`, `MCPRuntimeId`, `MCPRuntimeArn`, `AgentRuntimeId`, `AgentRuntimeArn`.

## Testing

### Role-based access tests

Run the `notebooks/01_deploy_and_test_rbac.ipynb` notebook to deploy the stack and test role enforcement interactively.

### M2M (CI-style) invocation

```bash
# Get M2M token (client secret stored in Secrets Manager: agentcore/dev/m2m-client)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "$TOKEN_ENDPOINT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$M2M_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$M2M_CLIENT_SECRET&scope=mcp/invoke mcp/finance mcp/hr agentcore/invoke" \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# Invoke agent
curl -X POST "https://bedrock-agentcore.$REGION.amazonaws.com/runtimes/$(python3 -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote('$AGENT_ARN', safe=''))")/invocations?qualifier=DEFAULT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is the stock price of AAPL?"}'
```

### Run evaluations locally

```bash
cd scripts
export AGENT_RUNTIME_ARN="..."
export AGENT_RUNTIME_ID="..."
export TOKEN_ENDPOINT="..."
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="..."
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
export OAUTH_SCOPE="mcp/invoke mcp/finance mcp/hr agentcore/invoke"
export EVAL_THRESHOLD="0.8"

pip install boto3 requests bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit
python3 agentcore_eval.py
```

## CI/CD Setup

The workflow runs on every pull request to `main`: it deploys the stack, invokes the agent, scores the
responses and fails the PR if any metric falls below `EVAL_THRESHOLD`. That means **a pull request causes
AWS credentials to be issued**, so the role it assumes needs scoping carefully — a role trusted by
`repo:OWNER/REPO:*` with `iam:*` permissions can be assumed by any PR in that repo and used to modify IAM.

The three steps below keep the PR-gating behaviour intact while bounding what a PR can do.

### 1. Trust the OIDC provider, scoped to this repo *and* the environment

If the account has no GitHub OIDC provider yet, create one for
`token.actions.githubusercontent.com` with audience `sts.amazonaws.com` (only one per account is allowed).

Then create a role whose trust policy names **both the repository and the environment**:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com" },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<OWNER>/<REPO>:environment:dev"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

Two details matter:

- **`environment:dev`, not `:*`.** GitHub only issues a token with this subject when the job declares
  `environment: dev`, which the `evaluate` job does. A trailing `:*` would let any branch, tag or PR in the
  repo assume the role.
- **`StringEquals`, not `StringLike`.** With `StringLike` plus a wildcard, a subject you did not intend can
  match.

### 2. Require a reviewer on the `dev` environment

In **Settings → Environments → `dev`**, add **Required reviewers**.

This is what makes PR-triggered deployment safe: credentials are not issued until a maintainer approves the
run, so a pull request containing hostile changes cannot reach AWS on its own. The quality gate still works
exactly as intended — it just waits for one approval on untrusted contributions.

### 3. Grant only what the workflow needs

`iam:*` on `Resource: "*"` lets anything that assumes the role create or modify arbitrary roles and
policies — that is account takeover, not a deployment permission. The policy below is what this workflow
actually requires. Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>`, and `AgentCoreCICDStack-*` if you rename the stack.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CdkDeployPlumbing",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["cloudformation:*", "ecr:*", "logs:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "CdkBootstrapVersionAndRoles",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ssm:GetParameter", "sts:AssumeRole"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:*:<ACCOUNT_ID>:parameter/cdk-bootstrap/*",
        "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/cdk-*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "StackResourceManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["cognito-idp:*", "bedrock-agentcore:*", "cloudwatch:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "EvaluationModelInvocation",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["bedrock:InvokeModel", "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "StackSecrets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
        "secretsmanager:CreateSecret", "secretsmanager:DeleteSecret", "secretsmanager:TagResource",
        "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue", "secretsmanager:UpdateSecret", "secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:<ACCOUNT_ID>:secret:agentcore/*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "TraceReadForEvaluation",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["xray:BatchGetTraces", "xray:GetTraceSummaries"],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "StackExecutionRolesOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole", "iam:DeleteRole", "iam:GetRole", "iam:PassRole", "iam:TagRole", "iam:UntagRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy", "iam:DetachRolePolicy", "iam:PutRolePolicy", "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
        "iam:GetRolePolicy", "iam:ListRolePolicies", "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
        "iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/AgentCoreCICDStack-*",
        "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/cdk-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Four of these are easy to miss:

- **`sts:AssumeRole` on `cdk-*`.** CDK bootstrap v2 does the real work through its own deploy, file-publishing
  and cfn-exec roles. Without permission to assume them, `cdk deploy` fails immediately regardless of what
  else the role can do.
- **`iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`.** `infrastructure/roles.py` adds a statement to the agent role's trust
  policy, so creating the role is not enough on its own.
- **Secrets Manager.** The workflow reads the M2M client secret directly rather than passing it through step
  outputs, so it needs read access as well as the create/delete the stack performs.
- **The IAM statement must stay resource-scoped.** Scoped to the stack's own role names, a compromised run can
  manage this stack's roles and nothing else.

Worth verifying rather than assuming, since a missing action only shows up mid-deploy:

```bash
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME> \
  --action-names sts:AssumeRole iam:CreateRole secretsmanager:GetSecretValue \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/cdk-hnb659fds-deploy-role-<ACCOUNT_ID>-<REGION>
```

Confirm the escalation paths are denied too — `iam:CreateUser`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, `iam:PutUserPolicy`,
and `iam:CreateRole` against a role outside the stack's own names should all come back `implicitDeny`.

### 4. Add the role ARN as a secret

Add the role ARN as the repository secret `AWS_ROLE_ARN`. <!-- pragma: allowlist secret --> <!-- reason: GitHub Actions secret NAME, not a credential value -->
If you define it as an *environment* secret instead, it must be on the `dev` environment, since that is what
the `evaluate` job targets.

The workflow checks this secret before configuring credentials and fails with an explicit message if it is
absent — otherwise the credentials action retries twelve times and reports only
`Could not load credentials from any providers`, which does not mention the secret.

> **Fork pull requests cannot pass.** GitHub withholds secrets from workflows triggered by PRs from forks, so
> the deploy-and-evaluate job cannot authenticate for external contributions. The `security-scan` job needs no
> credentials and still runs. If you require the evaluation check for merge, expect to run it on a branch in
> this repository rather than on a fork PR.

## Teardown

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
cdk destroy --force
```
